# Furnace-Consumption-Prediction-Model
Furnace Consumption Prediction Model using TimeSeries prediction


# Statement of Purpose:

The purpose of this regression model is to analyze and forecast the Furnace [kW] consumption based on the given dataset. By creating a linear regression model and training it on the dataset, we can predict the Furnace [kW] consumption in the future based on other features like temperature, humidity, visibility, apparent temperature, pressure, wind speed, cloud cover, wind bearing, precip intensity, dew point, and precip probability. This model can be useful for energy management companies and homeowners who want to optimize their energy consumption by predicting the Furnace [kW] usage in advance. The model's accuracy can be improved by fine-tuning the features and hyperparameters and by incorporating other time series forecasting techniques like seasonal decomposition and smoothing techniques.
